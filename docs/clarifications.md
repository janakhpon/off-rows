I want you to provide proper explanation as documentation files for these:

## docs/Q&A.md
1. what types did we used in the current codebase (interface? type? generic? assertion? fallback? ...etc) and why and how do we used them to achieve/solve what issues?
2. what error handling methods did we used in the current codebase and why and how do we used them to achieve/solve what issues?
3. what design patterns did we used in the current codebase and why and how do we used them to achieve/solve what issues?
4. what data structures did we used in the current codebase and why and how do we used them to achieve/solve what issues?
5. what algorithms did we used in the current codebase and why and how do we used them to achieve/solve what issues?
6. what best practices and conventions did we used in the current codebase and why and how do we used them to achieve/solve what issues?
7. How do we achieve the dynamic table creations, dynamic rows and columns managments in our implementation? why and how we implemented these ways to achieve/solve what?
