1. add about page
    - this is an open-source offline first data platform aim to help rural areas or areas with limited internet connection where data will be collected offline for health, or relief efforts matters.
2. In PWA, there's an issue related to "user can go to a certain route offline only user has visited that route online previously" and I don't like it; I want to have my whole app with all of its routes precached for offline first so, user can navigate in offline without that issue.
